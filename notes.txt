LinSearch.java: Uses a for loop to iterate through every element in the array.
Once it finds what it wants, it returns the index.

BinSearch.java: Assuming sorted, splits the array in half.
Navigates to the half where the target presides, then repeats.
Utilizes for loop.
(Unless we want recursion?)
