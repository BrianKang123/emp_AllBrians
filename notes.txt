discos:
    0. we utilized the LinSearch and BinSearch files from the library
    1. (Ordered)ArrayLists are not the best data structure to use for this lab
    2. 100 million ints seems to be the most an array can hold without changing the heap size
    3. we added an optional program argument for the array length to find out the last disco without having to edit the source code everytime

qccs:
    0. upon testing, we had a single run of binary search take 118ms but the other runs during the same execution took 0 to 1ms. why did this happen?
    1. is there a sort faster than binary search?
