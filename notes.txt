LinSearch.java: Uses a for loop to iterate through every element in the array. 
Once it finds what it wants, it returns the index. 

BinSearch.java: Assuming sorted, splits the array in half. 
Navigates to the half where the target presides, then repeats. 
Utilizes for loop. 
(Unless we want recursion?)
