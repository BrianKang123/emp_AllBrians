# Tests Performed
0. Create an array of 100,000,000 (or the argument passed through `String[] args`) integers with each element being its index.
1. Run 1000 trials of binary search with each trial taking a new randomly generated target to search for.

    a. For each trial, record the time it takes for the search.
2. Print out the times and indexes of the slowest and fastest searches along with average and total time of the 1000 trials
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 with linear search.

# Results
# Conclusions
Binary search seems to be the faster of the two search algorithms regardless of the array size. However, for binary search to work, the array that we want to search in must already be sorted.
