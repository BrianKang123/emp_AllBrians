Helper method taking parameter <length> to determine length of example OrderedArrayList
also takes parameter <index> determining the index of the target
creates an OrderedArrayList of <length> long, filled with 0s and 2s, with one 1 at <index>
Does so by checking the current index to <index>
uses .add method of OAL

TESTING: 
initialize <start> variable to current milis
run BinSearch, without printing
SOP current milis - <start>
reassign <start> to current milis
run LinSearch, without printing
SOP current milis - <start>
optionally cast to int and divide by 1000 for seconds
