PLAN IN PLAY:
    Generate an array of comparables of length 100,000,000 with each value being its index
    Perform 1000 trials of bin and lin searches on this array, each time searching for a newly randomly generated index
    Record the time it took to perform the search as well as the min/max times and the index of the element searched that resulted in that time
    Print out the average of time of each type of search after the 1000 trials for that type of search are completed along with other stats collected

OG PLAN:
    Helper method taking parameter <length> to determine length of example OrderedArrayList
    also takes parameter <index> determining the index of the target
    creates an OrderedArrayList of <length> long, filled with 0s and 2s, with one 1 at <index>
    Does so by checking the current index to <index>
    uses .add method of OAL

    TESTING:
    initialize <start> variable to current milis
    run BinSearch, without printing
    SOP current milis - <start>
    reassign <start> to current milis
    run LinSearch, without printing
    SOP current milis - <start>
    optionally cast to int and divide by 1000 for seconds
